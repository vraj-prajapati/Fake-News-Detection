# Fake-News-Detection

Fake News Detection Project
Overview
This project focuses on the development of a Fake News Detection system using Python, BeautifulSoup, web scraping techniques, and Streamlit for the user interface. The goal is to create a tool that can help users identify potentially misleading or fabricated information in news articles.

Features
Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup: The project utilizes BeautifulSoup, a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files, to extract information from news websites.

Streamlit Interface: The user interface is built using Streamlit, a powerful Python library for creating web applications with minimal effort. The interface allows users to input a news article or URL and receive an analysis of its authenticity.
